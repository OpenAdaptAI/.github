# Welcome to OpenAdapt.AI üëã

**OpenAdapt.AI** is an open-source **Generative Process Automation** framework that aims to transform task automation across applications and platforms. Designed as a baseline for evaluating agents, OpenAdapt.AI learns from human demonstrations to intelligently automate tasks, adapting dynamically to evolving workflows.

## üöÄ What is OpenAdapt.AI?

OpenAdapt.AI leverages advanced machine learning models to:
- **Observe and Learn**: Automatically learns from user interactions to generate automation scripts.
- **Automate Intelligently**: Adapts to software changes, varying workflows, and complex environments.
- **Ensure Privacy**: Privacy is a core focus, with robust data handling mechanisms to protect user data.

## üåü Key Features

- **Generative Process Automation**: Automates tasks using generative AI models that learn from demonstrations.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with browser apps (e.g., Chrome) and desktop applications.
- **Audio Narration Transcription**: Converts spoken instructions or feedback into automation scripts.
- **Flexible LLM Model Providers**: Supports multiple language model providers, including:
  - Online: **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **Google**
  - Offline (Work in Progress): **Ollama**, **vLLM**
- **Open Source**: Developed transparently and collaboratively by the community.
- **Privacy by Design**: Uses tools like AWS Rekognition, Microsoft Presidio, and Private-ai.com to ensure data privacy.
